# Animated_Icons

Animated Icons with javascript.  I got it from a tutorial for a reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XP-MRCUPZao. 
Javascript starting out is tough, so any reference and study material is a must. Most advanced Javascript, backend, or 
fullstack are practice references.  Not haveing a mentor or a guide is one thing, then trying to understand the demos
at times is another.  Mostly I watch examples of people that explain it well, then I practice my own version until something
comes of it.  I'm working on some personal projects based off the learning and studying of the resources that are accessible.  
This is my way of learning from the mentors and teachers I never had. Until then quote-"the adventure"{;-)=[]={
